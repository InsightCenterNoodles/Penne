Installation is as simple as:

```bash
pip install penne
```

Penne has a few dependencies:

* [`websockets`](https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): Websocket connections in Python.
* [`cbor2`](https://cbor2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Concise Binary Object Representation for messages.
* [`pydantic`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/dev-v2/): Data validation and coercion for parsing messages.

If you've got Python 3.9+ and `pip` installed, you're good to go.
