"""Python Client Library for NOODLES Protocol

The client library is based on the NOODLES messaging protocol for communicating with serverside data visualisation
applications. The client uses a websocket connection to send CBOR encoded messages. To customize its implementation, the
library offers hooks in the form of delegates classes which can be extended and overwritten.

Modules:
    core.py
    test_delegates.py
    handlers.py
    messages.py
